1. Script setup_gcp_environment.sh  is not re-runnable.  Setup of environment could be implemented with Terraform.
2. As development environment I used Cloud Shell Console. Because Widows is not a best environment for development and testing of bash scripts.
3. In load_data_gcs_firestore.py  method get_data_from_gcs_ndjson is good from memory usage point of view
    but for better performance I would try to mount Google storage as network drive and then use "ijson" python library for json loading.
    It works good with huge json files.
