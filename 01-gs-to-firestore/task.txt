1. Please write a python script called load_data_gcs_firestore.py that:
    a. Reads hotel property info from the file located in a google cloud storage bucket
    b. Transforms the data so that
        i. it is in json format
        ii. It contains a field that will allow it to be found and deduplicated
    c. Loads the data into a firestore collection
2. Design the script in a way that can support the following situations:
    a. The script can potentially run in an environment with limited amounts of memory
    b. The script can scale to handle 100,000 hotel records in one file
