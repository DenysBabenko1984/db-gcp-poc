## Task
Letâ€™s assume that this script needs to be run automatically twice a day. Please design
 the script so that it will be run twice a day at 8 am and 8pm.

    a. How can we check if it is running?
    b. If the terminal session disconnects while a script
    is running will it stop the script?
    c. How can we ensure the script will run regardless
    if the terminal session is connected?

## Solution:

We can use crontab for scheduling of script execution
To edit crontab:

```
crontab -e
```

Add row 
```
0 8 * * * /path/to/run_load_data_gcs_firestore.sh -e dev
```

>> a. How can we check if it is running?

With `crontab -l` you can verify that job is scheduled

Command `ps aux` report current processes

```bash
ps aux | grep run_load_data_gcs_firestore.sh
```

No, terminal disconnection will not stop the script.

If script executed by cron it runs as a background process managed by cron daemon.

It is not affected by terminal session.
